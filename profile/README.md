## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Dos DevOps is a personal initiative (of two) to share with the community the learning and knowledge acquired throughout our journey as devops.

Our intention is to build tools that are useful in our daily work, and we hope that they are also useful for others.

So you are very welcome to our small contributions, we start with great enthusiasm and dedication, we encourage you to try what we publish, and if it is useful to you, let us know.

Thank you so much for being here right now!
